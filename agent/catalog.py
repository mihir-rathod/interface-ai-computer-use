"""A small registry of known capability contracts -- what a human decides discovery should
produce (capability_id, typed input/output, success/error signals, target) before the agent
figures out how. See agent/recorder.py's docstring for why this split exists: a human
specifies the contract, the model figures out the implementation.

`_MOCKBANK_ERROR_HANDLING` is shared across capabilities rather than re-discovered per
capability -- MockBank's known failure modes (Phase 2) are curated once, the same way a real
system would maintain a reviewed library of known signatures for a given target app rather than
having an agent reinvent them for every new capability it learns.
