"""The LLM-driven observe -> decide -> act loop -- ASSIGNMENT_ORIGINAL.md 3.1. The model
decides WHAT to click/type/extract to accomplish the goal against real, live observed state
(the structured element list from surface/aria.py, not pixels). Turning the resulting
transcript into a typed, reusable artifact -- checkpoints, parameterization, error_handling --
is agent/recorder.py's job, deliberately kept separate: the model discovers, the code
structures. See REPORT.md heading 1 for the full rationale.

Stopping conditions (explicitly required by 3.1 -- "max steps, timeout, dead-end"): a step
budget, a wall-clock budget, and dead-end detection (the exact same tool call -- name and args --
repeated back to back, meaning the model is clicking something that isn't doing anything). All
three feed the same DiscoveryResult.stop_reason, which is exactly the kind of context
PROJECT_PLAN.md Section 5 says an escalation/pause path needs -- not built here (Phase 9), but
this is where that context originates.
