"""JSON persistence for capability artifacts.

One file per capability, named by capability_id -- discovery (agent/) writes here after a
successful run, and replay (replay/) reads from here. Deliberately just a directory of
files, not a database: matches Section 7's "we don't reward... building scaling
infrastructure" and there's no query pattern here more complex than "look up by id".
