"""SessionManager -- ASSIGNMENT_ORIGINAL.md 3.6: pause automation, let a human operate the
SAME live session (not a fresh one), then hand control back. Single-process, in-memory --
justified the same way as the rest of this system ("simpler is fine if justified"): a real
deployment would swap this for a persisted, multi-worker-safe session store, but the
control-transfer *model* (mode, a command queue, a resume signal) is what matters and doesn't
change, only where it lives.

Threading model: automation (DiscoveryLoop / ReplayEngine) runs on the thread that owns the
live Playwright page. The operator console (escalation/operator_console.py) runs in a
*different* thread (a background uvicorn server) and must never touch that page directly --
Playwright's sync API isn't safe to call across threads. So the console only ever calls
`request_action()`, which enqueues an intent; the actual `Surface.act()` call happens inside
`pause()`'s loop, on the automation thread, exactly like every other action in this system.
