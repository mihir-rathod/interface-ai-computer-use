"""The Surface interface -- ASSIGNMENT_ORIGINAL.md 3.7's seam between "how we perceive/act
on a surface" and "the recorded flow". WebSurface (surface/web.py, Playwright) is the only
implementation built here; LegacyWebSurface and DesktopSurface are a design extension
documented in REPORT.md heading 4, not built, but this is the interface they'd implement.

Both the discovery agent and the replay engine drive a Surface through the same two calls
(perceive/act) and the same Action/ActionResult shapes -- there is no separate "replay mode"
API. What differs between discovery and replay is *how an Action's target is chosen*: discovery
points at a `ref` from the most recent perceive() (an ephemeral id, meaningless outside that one
run); replay points at a `Target` (the portable locator fallback chain saved in an artifact).
